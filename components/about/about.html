    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lead flow-right">
      I was always into computers, tech and art. I wanted to go to college for computer programing years
      ago but had to put that on hold because of the bills and stress I got with buying a house with my mother to get my
       two sisters out of a bad area we lived in. At that time I worked in the warehouse as a forklift driver.
    </p>
    <p class="lead flow-left"> 
      Always planned on going back to school when things get better but then I ended getting Ulcerative colitis.
      I had to have three surgeries to remove my large intentines because I had an  infection that spread all over it.
      I had to wear an ileostomy bag after the first surgery and wore it until the third surgery. It was a unique 
      experience that made me stronger and appeciate life even more
    </p>
    <p class="lead flow-right">
      During the surgery time and the pandemic I started looking into different careers in IT. Web Developer caught
      my eyes because it is something you can do in a group or by yourself. Also love the fact I can learn everthing by 
      computer by training with Udemy, Youtube, google and other website for web development.
